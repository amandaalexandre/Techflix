## Netflix Bootstrap Clone

This is a clone of a previous Netflix Front End interface. The smallest carousels were done with Tiny Slider and the biggest one was the standard Bootstrap carousel utility.

This was part of the Carrefour Full Stack Web Developer recruiting process. Bootstrap was a requirement for this project, so some features look different than the actual Netflix website.
